Project Title: FIFA World Cup 2022 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Goal:
To analyze data from the FIFA 2022 World Cup to gain insights into team performance, identify key factors contributing to success, and discover interesting patterns or trends.
Data:
The dataset used in this project contained information about the 32 participating teams, including their final tournament ranking, games played, wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded, goal difference, and points.
Methodology:
Data Loading and Cleaning:
The data was loaded and inspected for any missing values or inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics:
Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) were calculated to understand the central tendencies and distributions of key variables.
Outlier Detection:
The z-score method was employed to identify potential outliers in "Goals For," highlighting teams that performed exceptionally well in terms of scoring.
Group Comparisons:
Teams were grouped by continent to analyze potential regional differences in goal-scoring performance.
An "Attacking Style" proxy was created using "Goals Per Game" to compare teams' attacking approaches.

Hypothesis Testing:
A two-sample t-test was conducted to assess if there was a statistically significant difference in "Goals Per Game" between European teams and teams from other continents.
Interactive Visualization:
An interactive scatter plot was created using Plotly to visualize the relationship between "Goals For," "Points," and "Continent," allowing for interactive exploration of team-specific details.
Key Findings:
Outliers:   Teams like Argentina and France emerged as potential outliers in "Goals For," indicating their exceptional offensive performance in the tournament.
Continental Differences:  The analysis revealed a noticeable difference in the average "Goals Per Game" between European teams and teams from other continents, suggesting potential variations in playing style or tactical approaches.
Hypothesis Test Result: The t-test [mention whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not and what it means].
Interactive Visualization Insights: [Mention any interesting patterns or trends observed in the Plotly visualization, e.g., clustering of teams based on continent or playing style].
Conclusion:
This EDA provided valuable insights into team performance at the FIFA 2022 World Cup. The analysis suggests that [summarize the major conclusions drawn from your findings, e.g., European teams tended to have a more attack-oriented approach, there were clear differences in performance across continents, etc.]. These insights can be useful for fans, analysts, and even teams themselves to understand the factors contributing to success in international football.
